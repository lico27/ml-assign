    "However, there are several low-frequency values in `vict_descent`. Knowing that this will be a feature in my model, and to avoid anonymisation issues, I will combine some of the lower-frequency ethnicities. I have chosen to group all groups of Asian descent, and to reassign the remaining ethnicities (all of which represented less than 1% of the dataset) to \"Other\". This decision was made with recognition of the sensitivities involved and acknowledgement that different Asian subgroups — such as Indian, Vietnamese, Korean - have distinct cultural/socioeconomic backgrounds. For another type of project, this aggregration would likely be inappropriate (UK Gov, 2020), but I deemed that grouping was most suitable to ensure the robustness of my model and avoid overly granular categories that could lead to unreliable output."
